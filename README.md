## Description
This is a backend server build on express and use aimple javascript? The main idea of this project is to build a simple backend on express? You can see a application that use this backend at https://urlshort.click/Weather

## Get Started
In the project directory, you can run:
`npm install`
This will install all the required modules in package.json

Navigate to CONTROLLERS folder. In there you can see the main four api endpoint this backend use. Go to each and set the api key. You can get all theese four api key for completely free going to respective website. See the website details below

For the different services I used different providers. I believe that these are the best API plans for the specific services.  You can subscribe to their free plan to get API_KEY and replace it in the source code
